A blog that's  running on node.js.

This is a learning experience for me.

I will use this code to run a blog at http://www.raynos.org

## Vague cloning instructions.

Fork / clone the code. 

`$ npm link`

Make sure your using node 0.4.10+ (only tested on 0.4.10)

Set process environments like the PORT, COUCH_USER & COUCH_PWD

  $ export PORT=4000
  $ export COUCH_USER=root
  $ export COUCH_PWD=nice_try
